# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques. 
It utilizes a dataset containing various features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc., 
to train a model that can predict whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes within a certain timeframe.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) from Kaggle.
It contains diagnostic measurements for several hundred female patients of Pima Indian heritage.

## Methodology
### The project follows these general steps:
- 1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- 2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable.
- 3. Model Selection: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.
- 4. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- 5. Model Deployment: Deploying the trained model for prediction.
